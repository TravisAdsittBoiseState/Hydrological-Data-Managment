###Cron Job Info###
cron is a time-based job scheduler built into Unix systems.  We use it to regularly execute our programs on an hourly basis.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron

addCronJob.sh is a script file which automatically adds the job to chron and instructs this job to execute hourly.

startProcess.sh is the script file which is executed hourly by cron.  This script checks to see if the main.py file is currently running.
If it is found running, then the startProcess.sh script kills main.py assuming it to be running in error since it should in no way take
an hour to run.  After killing it, or finding it not running, it will start main.py and then ensure it is running before the script exits.
You could alternatively have cron just launch main.py on an hourly basis, but then you have no way to know if you are starting another
instance, or if there has been some error with its launch.


for this project:
In addcronjob.sh nothing needs to be updated as long as the cronjob folder is not moved from it's current position within the repository.

AND

if you wish to re-name or relocate the log file for startProcess.sh; open the file and update the LOGFILE variable.
